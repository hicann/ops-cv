/**
* @brief Computes the overlap area between two groups of rotated boxes. \n

* @par Inputs:
* @li boxes: A 3D Tensor of type float32 with shape (B, 5, N). "N" indicates
* the number of boxes, and the value "5" refers to [x, y, w, h, theta] or
* [x1, y1, x2, y2, theta].
* @li query_boxes: A 3D Tensor of type float32 with shape (B, 5, K). "K"
* indicates the number of boxes, and the value "5" refers to [x, y, w, h,
* theta] or [x1, y1, x2, y2, theta].

* @par Attributes:
* @li trans: An optional attr. If true, the coordinate format is xyxyt;
* otherwise, it is xywht. Defaults to false.

* @par Outputs:
* overlaps: A 3D Tensor of type float32 with shape [B, N, K].

* @attention Constraints:
* In each batch, invalid boxes cannot appear before valid boxes.
