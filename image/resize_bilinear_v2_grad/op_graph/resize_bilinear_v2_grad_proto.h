*@brief Backwards calculation of ResizeBilinearV2.

*@par Inputs:
*@li grads: A 4D Tensor, represents the gradient of output of ResizeBilinearV2. Format must be NCHW or NHWC.
     Dtype must be float32, float16 or bfloat16.
*@li original_image: A 4D Tensor, represents the resized image of ResizeBilinearV2. Format must be the same as grads.
     When the dtype of grads is float16 or bfloat16, the dtype of original_image must be the same as grads, when the
     dtype of grads is float32, the dtype of original_image can be float32, float16 or bfloat16. The N, C dimension
     must be the same as grads.

*@par Outputs:
*y: A 4D Tensor, represents the gradient of original_image. Format and dtype and shape must be the same as original_image.

*@par Attributes:
*@li align_corners: An optional bool. If true, the centers of the 4 corner pixels of the input and output tensors are
     aligned, preserving the values at the corner pixels. Defaults to false.
*@li half_pixel_centers: An optional bool. If true, the center of pixels locate in [0.5, 0.5]. Defaults to false. 
*@li scales: An optional listfloat which has two elements. The first element represents the ratio of the H axis
     subscripts of pixels in grads to the H axis subscripts of pixels in y, only takes effect when align_corners is
     true and the value is greater than 0. The second element represents the ratio of the W axis subscripts of pixels in
     grads to the W axis subscripts of pixels in y, only takes effect when align_corners is true and the value is
     greater than 0.0f. Defaults to {0.0f, 0.0f}. 

*@par Third-party framework compatibility
*Compatible with tensorflow and pytorch ResizeBilinearV2Grad operator.
